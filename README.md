# OptimizeTnT

This repository will compile tips and tricks for solving optimization tasks of all kinds, continuous or discrete, constrained or unconstrained, smooth or nonsmooth, also special cases and seldomly talked-about problem cases, but some comparisons between solvers available in R packages will be included.

## The Remez problem

> The Remez problem is the task of finding or calculating the best polynomial approximation
> of a continuous function on a closed interval such that the maximum absolute distance between
> the polynomial and the function is minimized.
